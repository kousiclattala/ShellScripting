----------*File Permissions*---------------------

chmod ugo filename

The permissions are ranged from 0-7

0 = 0 = nothing 
1 = 1 = execute
2 = 2 = write
3 = 2+1 = w+x
4 = 4 = read
5 = 4+1 = r+x
6 = 4+2 = r+w
7 = 4+2+1 = r+w+x

chmod 777 filename

which means,
first 7 is for user
second 7 is for group
third 7 is for other
